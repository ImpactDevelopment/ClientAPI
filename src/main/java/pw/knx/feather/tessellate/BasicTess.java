/**
 * A standard implementation of the Tessellator interface.
 * <p>
 * The most noteworthy point to make about this Tessellator is that it *will not grow*.
 * Its size is final from the moment it's instantiated. If you attempt to add more data
 * than it can hold, it will throw an error. To create an automatically resizing
 * Tessellator, use the ExpandingTess implementation, also found in this package.
 * <p>
 * The voids in this interface return the Tessellator object for easy method chaining.
