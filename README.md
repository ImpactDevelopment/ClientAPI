## Development Kit
To use the Client API, you must download [Development Kit](https://github.com/ZeroMemes/ClientAPI-CDK). Instructions on how to set it up will be posted in the README.

## Concept
* Clients will be stored in a "Clients" folder inside of ".minecraft"
* To launch a client, you run the "ClientAPI Launcher" and choose the desired Client
* Minecraft will automatically open with the Client running

## Usage
Refer to the [Example](https://github.com/ZeroMemes/ClientAPI/tree/master/src/test/) to view how clients using the ClientAPI are structured.
